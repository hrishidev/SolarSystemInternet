# Solar System Internet

With intention to learn about space explorations, I am designing a Solar System Internet similar to [DTN of NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/disruption_tolerant_networking)  

Starting with simplest back of the napkin notes, end product will be detailed specifications having similarity with real world systems.
Iterative changes will be done to this document as more information is gathered/ feedback is received.

**Problem Statement**

In current infrastructure, there are limitations on receiving data from rovers and orbiters of MARS. 
Solar System Internet will consist of relay hardware systems in space to increase throughput capacity of data trasmission

Wish me luck ðŸ˜€
