# SolarSystemInternet

With intention to learn about space explorations, I am designing a Solar System Internet similar to [DTN of NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/engineering/technology/disruption_tolerant_networking)  

Starting with simplest back of the napkin notes, end product will be detailed specifications having similarity with real world systems.

Iterative changes will be done to this document as more information is gathered/ feedback is received 

Wish me luck ðŸ˜€
